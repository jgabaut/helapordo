# helapordo

  A roguelike terminal game.

  Small personal project.

  It uses ncurses to provide text interface.

  Here's a gif of a new game being started.

## Building <a name = "building"></a>

  The code should build for `x86_64-Linux`, `aarch64-Linux`, `Windows` (through `x86_64-w64-mingw32`).

  *DISCLAIMER:*  The `Windows` build is proof-of-concept as:

  - It doesn't run correctly ATM. WIP (maybe)
  - `Windows` terminal can't change its color pairs as far as I know, rendering it unsuitable for the game.
    - A solution to reject extra/modified colors could be implemented.

### Dependencies <a name = "dependencies"></a>

  - `autoconf` and `automake` are needed to generate the Makefile used to compile the game.
  - `ncurses-dev` is needed as a library dependecy.
  - `python` is needed to generate `./src/palette.c` and `./src/palette.h`.


### Initialising submodules <a name = "init_submodules"></a>

  You can initialise the submodules by running:

    `git submodule update --init`

### Autoreconf and ./configure <a name = "autotools"></a>

  You may need to run `automake --add-missing` to ensure your system provides the missing files needed by `autoreconf`.

  Run `autoreconf` to generate the `./configure` script. Run the script to generate the `Makefile` used for the project.

### Enable game debug  <a name = "debug_access"></a>

  After generating the `./configure` script, you may enable game debug mode by running:

    `./configure --enable-debug=yes`

  Which should prepare a `Makefile` with the correct macro definitions to turn on game debug at compile time. To reset the `Makefile` to release state, run:

    `./configure --enable-debug=no`

  If you're compiling without using `autotools`, you may want to define the compiler macros:

  - `-DHELAPORDO_DEBUG_LOG`  (Enables debug logging)
  - `-DHELAPORDO_DEBUG_ACCESS` (Enables the -d flag to turn on debug mode)

### Build with `x86_64-w64-mingw32` <a name = "mingw32_build"></a>

  After generating the `./configure` script, you may switch target host and use `mingw32` with:

    `./configure --host x86_64-w64-mingw32`

  Which should prepare a `Makefile` with the correct macro definitions. To reset the `Makefile` to release state, run:

    `./configure --host $(./config.guess)`

  You may need to correct the `configure.ac` flags if your installation does not have the expected layout, providing the correct paths for:

  - `mingw32`'s `lib` and `include` dirs, for `ncursesw`
  - `mingw32`'s correct `gcc`.

  Preprocessor macros based on the `Makefile` passing `-DMINGW32_BUILD` are present to enable/disable `Windows` specific code.

### Compiling and running <a name = "compiling"></a>

  Once you have the `Makefile`, you can compile the project by running, in its directory:

    `make`

  The build chain expects some files to be generated from already given ones.

  If you want to build without using `make`, you can see in the `Makefile.am` how to generate `./src/palette.c`, `./src/palette.h`, `./src/anvil__helapordo.c` and `./src/anvil__helapordo.h`

  You can have a look at the CLI syntax with:

    `./helapordo -h`

## Installation <a name = "installation"></a>

  You can install the game at `~/helapordo-local` and have a working alias for your PATH by running:

    `make install`
    `make do_alias`

  The second command needs root privileges to symlink `~/helapordo-local/helapordo` to `/usr/local/bin/helapordo`.

  You can skip the alias and maybe add the `helapordo-local` dir to your PATH instead.

## Generating documentation <a name = "make_doc"></a>

  You can use `doxygen` to generate docs in both HTML and latex.

  To generate the documentation run, *from the repo dir*:

  ```
  doxygen docs/helapordo.doxyfile
  ```

  To have a pdf version, you can install a tex compiler and, inside `doxygen/latex`, run:
  ```
  make
  ```

## Latest Release <a name = "latest_release"></a>

  I try to upload precompiled binaries for:

  - `x86_64-Linux`
  - `aarch64-Linux` (from [Termux](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/) on Android).
  - `x86_64-w64-mingw32` (*NOT WORKING.* Any help with debugging is appreciated.)

  Some releases may offer a precompiled binary for:

  - `darwin-arm64`
